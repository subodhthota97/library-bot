| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <tr><th colspan=3> Setup </th></tr> |
| **Problem Stmt** | 15.0/15 | Good job |
| **Bot Description** | 10.0/10 | Good job |
| **Use Cases** | 13.0/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />You have a start on your Use Cases, but they need Revisions:    UC2 -- wouldn't you return links?   Isn't that close the documentation?<br><br>UC3  doesn't seem as well motivated as UC2 -- I know you possess untapped creativity here! |
| **Wireframes** | 12.5/15 | Wireframes should be used just to show information layout, but this sequence appears to also show a thorough picture of all the use cases. Almost equivalent to the storyboard. |
| **Storyboard** | 15.0/15 | Good job |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 22.5/30 | What you have is fine, but the milestone requires "This section should be several diagrams" |

| **Total** | 88.0/100 |  |
